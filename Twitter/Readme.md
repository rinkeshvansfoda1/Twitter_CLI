twitter file is note working properly( it is basically for testing)
Acc is used to get the Twitter Account Information
hash is used to get the hashtag tweet
okay is used to get the Particular account tweet
searchacc is used to search the account on the twitter



Steps for twitter used are:
pointing the tweet and inspect them and then under network section XMR/JSON file under that usertweet, userbyscreen click on it.
Then right click on the usertweet and then copy the 'curl as (bash)' not all 'curl as (bash)'.
After copying the link then go to the curlconverter where paste the link and select language as python(or any other language which you like to prefer), then paste that code in your interested language.
(Then Replace your old headers, params, response with the newly generated.)
